# Python Playground

This repository is meant to store quick implementations / projects of for my ideas and tests. 
I did it for the lulz.

## Here's a quick list of the projects:
* Emulator - My first time trying to implement an actual CPU emulator. Still learning the dark magic and mind tricks.
* NeuralNetwork - A very basic Neural Network. Uses forward and back propagation. The CNN operations are not finished.
* Steganography - Steganography child's play. Will hide all sorts of stuff in other stuff.
